# Portfolio_Rebalancer
script to calculate how much of each index fund you should buy to rebalance your portfolio back to original allocations

usage: 
1) input the names of your funds, and their desired allocations (in decimal form)
2) input how much money is currently in each fund
3) input how much money you have to invest (input 0 if you just wish to rebalance. Negative numbers are fine too, if you want to pull money out)
4) Portfolio_Rebalancer will output how much to buy and sell from each fund
